## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to determine:
-  Viability of Bicycle Ride Sharing Services in New York City.
-  Determine periods of use including breakdowns by gender, subscribers, and for maintenance determination.
-  Provide comparisons about possible expansion into other geographic areas.

    <h3 align="left">This chart shows the total number of trips logged during the month of August 2019.  2,344,224 total trips were made during the analysis period.\n
     The data collected shows peak times of ride sharing occured between the periods of 7am through 10am and 4pm through 8pm.

      that the majority of bike share activity occurs during the standard work week, Monday through Friday.  However, it is also noted that increased usage occurs during\n
      the weekend days, between the hours of 8am and 6pm.  From this, it can be concluded that the bike sharing program is being used for both business and pleasure by our\n
      users.

    <h3 align="left">This line chart shows the Trip Duration totals.  The most common length of rental is 5 minutes in duration.  However, the evidence supports\n
      that the majority of the total 2.3+ million rides last between 1 and 27 minutes in length.

    <h3 align="left">A heatmap view of ride start times, broken down by day of the week and gender, corroborates the previous slide by hour breakdown.\n
      We can see that male users highest period of usage still falls within the standard work week commute times, with recreational use mostly on Saturday.\n
      We can also see that female ridership mimics the male pattern, as the hours of increased usage shows similar results.\n
      The interesting aspect of this chart though is the non-identified user (see the Tableau link to scroll).  Non-identified users show more use during\n
      weekend recreational hours.  This is further explained on the next slide.

    <h3 align="left">This heatmap shows usage broken down by Day of the Week, Gender, and whether the user is a Subscriber or single use Customer.\n
      As can be seen, the subscription model is in this analysis accounts for the majority of ride share, for both male and female users.\n\n
      The inverse is shown for non-identified users.  The majority of non-identified users fall within the single use category.  This could indicate\n
      that the average one time user simply does not wish to share their personal data, or that the login information sharing was kept to a minimum\n
      in order to access the bike faster.  Further analysis could determine whether these are impulse rentals or repeated single use by a customer\n
      where marketing can consider adjusted strategies to convert the user into a subscriber.

## Summary:

-  Urbanized areas show consistently more bike sharing then outlying/suburb areas.
-  Bike sharing peak times conform to the standard work week, during commute times.  However, periods of activity
